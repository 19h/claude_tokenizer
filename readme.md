## Features

- Tokenizer for Anthropic's AI assistant, Claude.
- `tokenize` convenience method to tokenize an arbitrary string.
- `count_tokens` convenience method to count tokens in an arbitrary string.
- JSON tokenization file support.

## Installation

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
claude_tokenizer = "0.1.0"
```

Then, run `cargo build` to build your project.

## Usage

### Example

To use the `claude_tokenizer` crate, add the following to your Rust file:

```rust
fn main() {
    let text = "Hello, I'm using Claude!";

    let tokens = claude_tokenizer::tokenize(text).unwrap();
    let token_count = claude_tokenizer::count_tokens(text).unwrap();

    println!("Tokens: {:?}", tokens);
    println!("Token count: {}", token_count);
}

// Tokens: [(10002, "Hello"), (16, ","), (373, "Ä I"), (2338, "'m"), (1626, "Ä using"), (37918, "Ä Claude"), (5, "!")]
// Token count: 7
```

## Disclaimer

It's currently unknown whether it's permitted to embed the tokenization JSON file provided by Claude. We're doing so for now, but if there are any issues, please let us know.

**Note to Anthropic employees:** If you're reading this and embedding the tokenization JSON file is not allowed, please contact me via email to resolve the issue.
